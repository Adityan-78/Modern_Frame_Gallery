The Modern Frame - Static Website
==============================

Name: [Your Name]

Hi!

This is my static website project for **The Modern Frame**, which is a fictional modern art gallery.  
The whole site is made only with **HTML and CSS** — there’s no JavaScript at all.

------------------------------
📁 What’s included:
------------------------------
- **index.html** — The home page. It has a short welcome message, one featured artwork, details about the next exhibition, and an embedded YouTube video for a quick gallery tour.

- **gallery.html** — This page shows four pieces of artwork in a simple 2×2 grid layout. Each artwork has a title and a short description.

- **about.html** — A bit of history about the gallery, an ordered list of past exhibitions, and an unordered list of staff members.

- **contact.html** — Basic contact details like address, phone, and email shown in a table. There’s also a table for studio hours and a link to a virtual tour that opens in a new tab.

------------------------------
✅ Features I added:
------------------------------
- A fixed navigation bar at the top that works on all pages.
- Semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
- Used Flexbox for the navigation and CSS Grid for the gallery.
- Added hover effects for images and nav links so they look more interactive.
- Used a real YouTube video instead of a local file for the tour on the home page.
- There’s a small “Open House!” banner on the home page that blinks using CSS animation.
- Added placeholder images from picsum.photos — so you’ll always see different random images.
- Tried to use named colors, HEX, RGB, and HSL in different parts of the CSS.
- I ran the site through the W3C Validator to fix any HTML mistakes.

------------------------------
💻 Tested on:
------------------------------
- Google Chrome
- Firefox

------------------------------
📌 Notes:
------------------------------
- To check the site, just open **index.html** in your browser.
- Make sure the `css` folder is in the same place and the `style.css` file is linked.
- The YouTube video and placeholder images need an internet connection.

Everything should be working fine. If there’s any issue, please let me know!

Thank you!
